# ðŸ‘‹ Hi I am @P867-case

## BASE IN MY WORKS

My projects are based on these frameworks:
  - Aiogram 
  - Kivy/Kivymd 
  - Django
  - requests
  - BeautifulSoup

## Operating principle 

In my works I am not afraid to use third-party sites and projects, as they are all open access. My projects are conditionally free, you can download them and install them, but to use them you need to make a small donation, the minimum amount is $2.

> the code is open, but there is no access to the functionality.
